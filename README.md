# SALES-PREDICTION-MODEL-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING


Sales prediction models are used by businesses to forecast the future sales based on historical data and other relevant factors. One popular algorithm used for this purpose is the Random Forest algorithm. we will explore how to build a sales prediction model using the Random Forest algorithm.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and avoid overfitting. It works by randomly selecting a subset of features and observations and building decision trees based on these subsets. The predictions from these trees are then combined to form the final prediction.

To build a sales prediction model using Random Forest, follow these steps:

Collect data: Collect historical sales data along with other relevant variables such as marketing spend, seasonality, promotions, etc.

Preprocess data: Clean the data by removing missing values, outliers, and irrelevant variables. Convert categorical variables into numeric variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Split data: Split the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to build the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

Build the model: Train the Random Forest model on the training data. Tune the hyperparameters such as the number of trees, the maximum depth of the trees, and the number of features to consider at each split.

Evaluate the model: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE).

Deploy the model: Once the model is built and evaluated, deploy it.
